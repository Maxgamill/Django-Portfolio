                <h3>Hey! So you wanted to know a little more about me?</h3>
                <p class="maintxt">
                    My name is Max Gamill and I'm currently a student at the University of Leeds, 
                    in my final year of a Physics Integrated Masters course. My passion for computing 
                    stemmed from the Python courses and projects completed throughout my time in 
                    University.
                    <br><br>
                    I thoroughly enjoyed the Universities’ computing modules which surrounded the 
                    basic use of Python (Computing 1), through to data analysis (Computing 2) and 
                    numerical simulations and modelling (Molecular Dynamics and Simulations) where 
                    each module built on the last. I also had the opportunity to participate in the 
                    Group Industrial Project module where my team and I partnered with RBSL to use 
                    MATLAB to compare 
                    the effectiveness of deep learning algorithms to teach a simulated robot to walk. 
                    We researched, and applied knowledge from areas such as the Maths behind 
                    the learning agents, creating the model, neural networks, matrix manipulation and 
                    evaluation of the agents which was a very exciting project from start to finish.
                    Unfortunately, anything beyond this description cannot be mentioned and so, this 
                    project surrounding the use of reinforcement learning will not appear in this 
                    portfolio.

                <h3>Placement</h3>
                <p class="maintxt">
                    My time at University also included a placement year at IBM where I worked as a 
                    Cogonos Analytics level 2 Support Analyst in which I addressed issues 
                    clients had with the Cognos Analytics software – a powerful business analytics tool 
                    used to find intelligent insights of a business’s operations and create business 
                    reports. 
                    <br><br>
                    This role included managing my own “queue” of customers who were experiencing 
                    issues with the product and to identify the source of the issue and either fix it, 
                    or develop a work-around. There were 3 main types of issues that I was expected to 
                    resolve: questions regarding the configuration/usage of the product or the 
                    customers’ environment (security/configuration/admin), product defects (replicating 
                    and testing) and finally, resolving error messages (forensic examination of log 
                    files and identifying the source of the error).
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout my role, I closed over 232 cases, received 6 perfect 10 surveys, raised 
                    20 product defects, authored 36 technical documents, edited a further 11 technical 
                    documents, created 2 team wiki pages to help with difficult support processes and 
                    achieved a team best 79 net promoter score. It was a tough job but in helping 
                    clients solve their issues, I learnt a great amount of back-end web-server setup 
                    which enabled me to carry out this project.

                <p class="maintxt">
                    Enough with the tech talk now, I like to escape the mild stress of ambitious 
                    self-set deadlines by indoor rock climbing. I like the problem-solving aspect and 
                    analysing the routes before you ascend. Although, I've never attempted any 
                    competitions, I want to really push myself this year and try one for the fun of it.
                    <br><br>
                    I also love traveling and having mainly roamed around Europe, I’ve only recently 
                    explored other areas of the world such as Morocco, Singapore and the Philippines 
                    which were extraordinarily beautiful. 
                    <br><br>
                    I’m a keen skier and enthusiastic for trying new experiences, with my latest 
                    venture taking on a skydiving static line course (R.A.P.S.) which is a fancy way 
                    of saying you’re flying (or falling) solo!

                    <p class="maintxt">
                        The idea of building a web portfolio was a way to take on the challenge 
                        of learning new programming languages as well as the backend of web 
                        development to create an interactive webpage showing my previous coding 
                        projects. This project enabled me to gather a hands-on experience with 
                        RaspberryPi OS (a Linux-esque operating system), HTML, CSS, JS, Django 
                        and a dash of AJAX.

                        Now for the technical bit! This project runs off a Raspberry Pi which is 
                        being used as the subject of port-forwarding to operate as the webserver. 
                        The Raspberry Pi is used headless with a Linux-based OS (RaspberryPi OS) 
                        and hence all modifications to programs on the Pi was done via command 
                        line SSH and SFTP connections and modification of files was done using vi 
                        or through Visual Code Studio and SFTP’d to the server.

            </div>
            <div class="breakdown">
                <div class="leftBox">
                    <h4>Webserver/SSL</h4>
                    <p class="maintxt">
                        Using Apache2 webserver and Openssl, virtual hosts were created and used 
                        to handle http and https requests along with the Django application. 
                        However, https uses a self-signed certificate (for learning reasons) and 
                        so it is disliked by any machines which do not have the certificate 
                        installed and trusted but be assured certificate is there and working 
                        correctly using a TLS1.3 connection as seen by the image on the right. 
                        The self-signed certificate was made by first issuing a certificate 
                        authority (or root certificate) in which the ssl certificate could be 
                        signed under. The shell script across was created and run to create the 
                        ssl certificate, but, as stated earlier, will only work on client machines 
                        where the root certificate has been installed and trusted. 
                        <br><br>
                        So, although this was a great learning experience, it was not practical 
                        for users who wanted to visit the site and were bombarded by messages 
                        labelling the site as insecure due to the trust issue. This pushed me to 
                        try the free options such as going through “letsencrypt.org” who provide 
                        a free recognised certificate authority to sign ssl certificates. Here I
                        also included rewrite rules to send http traffic at http://www.maxgamill.com
                        to https://www.maxgamill.com and also set up crontab's to renew the ssl 
                        certificate and Dyanmic DNS switching for the google domain.

                    <h4>Request Handling</h4>
                    <p class="maintxt">
                        As the ".py" files were not automatically handled by Apache, Django or 
                        Flask had to be used and as Django seemed more intuitive and was already 
                        written in python I went with Django. This required building a Python3 
                        virtual environment and modifying the websites’ configuration file to use 
                        a virtual environment to run the Python project scripts without interfering 
                        with normal server functionality.
                        <br><br>
                        The next task was sending a variable to the Python scripts from the webpage 
                        without needing to refresh the page. This is where AJAX came in handy. 
                        Using the JQuery library, an AJAX request was sent to my switchboard script 
                        on clicking the submission button which contained the data or value of the 
                        input box whether this was a canvas or text input. The data arrived at the 
                        switchboard URL in the form of a dictionary. This way the switchboard could 
                        differentiate between each submission by the key that was used which told 
                        it if it came from the test page or the neural network page and could then 
                        forward the value to the correct project script. The script would then produce 
                        an output and be returned to the client’s page using the HttpResponse method. 
                        JavaScript would then update a div element or push an alert to the user with 
                        the result of the users input.
                        <br><br>
                        For the Neural Network project, the canvas or png image had to be sent instead 
                        as the input for the Python function and return a number as the guess. This 
                        was done by first converting the canvas image to a URL string using the 
                        “toDataURL()” method and then passed into the sever for the image to be rebuilt 
                        from the URL. From the server, the views.py file decodes the base64 bytes URL 
                        and converts it back to a png which is then “compressed” and fed into the 
                        project script.
                        <br><br>
                        In the case of the Spread of Disease and Ising Spin Model projects, an image 
                        needed to be returned to the client. This is a tad harder than just simply 
                        receiving a string but similar to sending the canvas in the Neural Network 
                        project as the outputted figure first needed to be encoded in base64 and then 
                        passed back to the client as a URI string. This then appended to the png header 
                        tag and could then be used to update an image tag’s source to show the graph.

                        The HTML, CSS and JS was all built from scratch using a mix of my own knowledge, 
                        free courses, W3 schools and Stack Overflow. The HTML files don’t differ much to 
                        standard HTML files other than some necessary Django admissions such as CSRF 
                        tokens and loading of “static” files which are necessary for the secure sending 
                        of data to the server and locating the CSS file/images on the server respectively.
                        <br><br>
                        The HTML file can essentially be read by right-clicking the webpage and selecting 
                        “inspect element”. This will show the HTML elements that make up the page as well 
                        as the JavaScript that enables the whole portfolio to be on a single page (not 
                        the most efficient for loading times I know but I like the togetherness of it) 
                        such as the simultaneous switching of CSS block values to hide and show elements.
                        Additionally, all icons were made by myself using Pages.

                        drew is stored, it is still good practice and insightful to implement them). For this, 
                        all access to the server via SSH and SFTP is on abnormal ports along with the 
                        implementation of a firewall (Uncomplicated Firewall). This has allowed only incoming 
                        traffic on the standard http and https ports to the server as well access to the 
                        abnormal tcp port for ssh connections.

                        To stop just anyone guessing the password for the server, 4096 bit key-based 
                        authentication is used and root access omitted and super users have password protected 
                        root access. On top of this, fail2ban is used to create jails for IP addresses which 
                        attempt to access the server multiple times to prevent brute force attacks.

                    <p class="maintxt"> 
                        During one of my laboratory modules in University, I was tasked with 
                        investigating the surfaces of different materials using an atomic force 
                        microscope. The issue was that I had to take many images and the software 
                        exported these in a '.dib' format whereas the analysing software I was using 
                        gave poor results for this format and better results in the '.bmp' format due 
                        to the types of signals each of these images used. Hence, I designed a file 
                        extension renamer to save time during this operation.
                        <br><br>
                        Obviously, this is the brute-force method to get this to work as file 
                        extensions cannot normally be changed in such a way. However, this solution 
                        worked well for the problem I encountered.

                        Unfortunately, I don't think you'd want your own files to switch extensions 
                        and so this part will not be intractable. However, on your left you will see 
                        a short video of the script in use.

                        Building on this project, one may suggest modifying the code to allow the user 
                        to input their own file path and file extensions to rename, but in my case, 
                        this would have slowed things down as the atomic force microscopy images came 
                        in large doses and rather infrequently so it was easier just to run the script 
                        as and when.

                        As seen looking at the code on the right, this one is pretty simple. Firstly, 
                        it imports the “os” library which allows modification of the system files etc. 
                        Then the variables of 1) A string of the path to the folder containing the files 
                        to be renamed, 2) A string of the files’ extension that you want to rename, and 
                        3) The string of the new file extension. 
                        <br><br>
                        The for loop just loops over all the 
                        files in the specified folder path and splits the file into 2 parts - the name 
                        and the extension using the '.' as the delimiter. Now if the extension matches 
                        the old extension (2) then the old extension is replaced by (3).

                        During one summer, I was introduced to the concept of neural networks and wanted 
                        a deeper understanding of how they worked, not just using some premade libraries 
                        but how the weights of the nodes are calculated using matrices. So, I built a 
                        neural network which tries to identify hand-written numbers from 0-9 based on the 
                        book “Make Your Own Neural Network” by Tariq Rashid.
                        <br><br>
                        Unfortunately, it was not as easy as copy and pasting code from the book due to 
                        the depreciated function “scipy.misc.imread()”as this was outdated and so a 
                        solution for converting the “.png” file to a useable Numpy array needed to be 
                        found as well as a further function to “compress” the array to the dimensions of 
                        the neural network.

                        Have a go at drawing your own number in the canvas opposite to feed into the 
                        neural network algorithm and see if it can guess your number! 
                        <br><br>
                        Bear in mind, the current version of the neural network can only guess single 
                        digit numbers but modifications to the number of nodes in the output layer and 
                        for better guesses, also the hidden layer as well as much more training data 
                        could help improve this project. Another point that must be made is that the 
                        network is trained on images of hand written numbers. This means that the result 
                        may be slightly inaccurate as the numbers you create on the canvas are not hand 
                        drawn with a pen like the training data. 
                        <br><br>
                        One could improve the project by incorporating a feature in which, if the guess 
                        is incorrect, the user can send a label of the correct value to the server which 
                        stores the label and canvas picture to train a better neural network.

                        Firstly, let’s check out the neural network class. When the class is first called, 
                        some variables are initially set. These are the number of input, hidden and output 
                        nodes which are used to create a matrix of weights between each of the layers of 
                        nodes. These weights are initially set using random values from a normal 
                        distribution about the mean of 0 and a standard deviation based on the number of 
                        nodes in the next layer. The probability distribution of the normal function can 
                        be seen below:
                    </p>

                    <p class="maintxt">    
                        The returned matrix is a many-to-many representation so that each node in the 
                        first layer has associated weights with all nodes in the next layer. Then the 
                        activation function is made using the expit function to decide whether the signal 
                        passed through to the nodes is strong enough to be counted as this converts all 
                        signals to the range 0 to 1. The expit function can be seen below:

                    <h4>Training</h4>
                    <p class="maintxt">
                        The training function takes the inputs of the training data (training_list) 
                        along with their labelled answers (targets_list) and a save flag. For this 
                        project, the training data is a “.txt” or “.csv” file containing the numbers’  
                        label turned into an array where it is the only possible answer (e.g. “6” -> 
                        “0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0”), and comma separated greyscale colour values for the 
                        28x28 image. 
                        <br><br>
                        The training data array is then used to calculate the signals passing into and 
                        out of each neural network layer utilising the activation function mentioned 
                        earlier. Then the error from the neural network needs to be calculated for each 
                        layer and back-propagated to update the values of the node weights. This is done 
                        using via a scaling factor or learning rate as to not update the weights too 
                        greatly where they can produce much larger errors and miss the optimum weight 
                        values. The formula for updating the weights follows that for a large error, the 
                        final outputs will be small (but not zero) and so will be updated correctly over 
                        multiple iterations. For a small error, the updating of the weights will be small 
                        and should get progressively smaller with every iteration tending to a maximum.
                        <br><br>
                        The save flag dictates whether files containing the weights of each layer in the 
                        network after it has finished training will be saved. This sets a foundation for 
                        the use of the neural network to be queried without running the very lengthy 
                        training process.

                    <p class="maintxt">
                        The query function takes the comma separated greyscale image values (inputs_list) 
                        and a trained network flag. If the trained network flag is false, the train 
                        function must have been used previously to train the network. The signals are then 
                        passed through each layer via a dot product with the weights and the results 
                        undergo the activation function before returning a 1x10 array (representing each 
                        possible single digit number) with values of the networks probability for each 
                        number as the final outputs.

                        If the trained network flag is true, the previously saved files of the trained 
                        network weights are opened and read. They undergo some processing to put the values 
                        into the correct format of the “Wih” and “Who” arrays, then are used for calculating 
                        the signals passing through each layer the same way as before, again, returning the 
                        final output probability array.

                    <p class="maintxt">
                        As the training data was 28x28 pixels, the neural network was setup to handle this 
                        input but the image received from the webpage was much larger, a compression function 
                        had to be made for the queried image file to work with the neural network. This was 
                        much more pleasing then to have the user draw their number in a 28x28 pixel canvas.
                        <br><br>
                        It works by first calculating the size ratio of the square input image to the square 
                        compressed resolution the user wants. The first for loop counts each compressed 
                        resolution pixel along the x axis and the second for loop does the same for the y 
                        axis. Inside the loop, the input image is cut into segments with area of the ratio 
                        squared and greyscale values normalised. Then the greyscale values of these segments 
                        are summed to a single value which is appended to a list. This process is repeated 
                        over the whole image until the list of single values is put into an array and reshaped 
                        into the compressed resolution. Returning the compressed image as an array of greyscale 
                        values.

                        Now I have to piece it all together inside the views.py and switchboard.py files 
                        inside the Django web app. I start with the AJAX request sending the canvas base64 
                        data to the switchboard URL. The AJAX dictionary is checked to make sure the POST 
                        request is from the canvas and then the base64 decoded data is written to a file cutting 
                        off the png header.
                        <br><br>
                        The file is then used as the input to the trainedNetwork function inside the switchboard 
                        where the learning rate and layer node variables are set. The input image, although black 
                        and white, still has RGB colour values so only the greyscale colour value of the array is 
                        taken and then used to create the compressed 28x28 image. The image is then put into a 1-D 
                        array and the greyscale values modified so that instead of pure white being 255, it is 0, 
                        and pure black once 0 is now 1, to replicate the training data. Then the neural network is 
                        initialised and queried using trained weights (as the trainedNetwork flag is true) and the 
                        largest value of the output probability array is chosen as the guessed label and returned 
                        to the webpage as a HttpResponse.

                    <h3>The Brief</h3>
                    <p class="maintxt">
                        During my "Molecular Dynamics: Theory and Simulation" module, I had to take 
                        on multiple projects to boost our understanding of implementing models for 
                        mathematical simulations. In this project, I was tasked with producing graphs 
                        which modelled an epidemic (topical I know!) based on the S.I.R. model. This model 
                        assumes one or more infected persons are introduced to a community where all 
                        are equally susceptible to the disease, it is spread by contact and the epidemic 
                        lasts much shorter than the life expectancy of the persons (so the population 
                        remains the same).
                        <br><br>
                        I then used a Monte-Carlo simulation to solve for the number of 
                        infected students and the number of susceptible students, day-by-day, from a 
                        larger school population. Within the school there could be older students which 
                        already had the infection and are immune to the disease, some who are 
                        susceptible and others that are infected. It was then required that I calculate 
                        the size of the epidemic (total number of students infected).
                        <br><br>
                        In this project, I scored 10/10.

                        Unfortunately, current students might use this section to plagiarise code for 
                        easy marks, so, I am unable to share the code in this section. However, I will 
                        use this section to provide more details about the simulation without the use 
                        of the code.
                        <br><br>
                        The theory as stated in the brief is based on the S.I.R. model where the 
                        population is either susceptible (S), infected (I) or removed (R). The scheme 
                        follows the equations across:
                        <br><br>
                        Where the first step describes the transmission of the disease and the second 
                        step describes the recovery from the infection with k2 and k1 as the respective 
                        rate constants for each step.

                        In terms of the code, initially variables are initialised and a matrix 
                        containing the three categories of student infection are made where 0 represents 
                        immune, 1 is susceptible and 2 is infected. Then, loop through the population 
                        matrix so when an infected person is found, choose at random someone to try and 
                        infect if not immune. Then, for the infected person initially found, undergo a 
                        Monte-Carlo simulation to see whether the student recovers and make them immune 
                        and continue to loop through the population matrix and do this for each day of 
                        the epidemic.
                        <br><br>
                        The Monte-Carlo simulations done in this task use the law of random numbers and 
                        proportionality to see if, for example, someone recovers from the infection. In 
                        this case, you can see if a number that is randomly generated from 0 to 1 is 
                        within the limit to be cured (less than the recovery probability). Over many 
                        iterations, and if the numbers are indeed truly randomly generated, you can 
                        prove that the proportion of those iterations that lie under the boundary is 
                        that of the recovery probability.
                        <br><br>
                        This is a very basic model and so is not as accurate and one may like, 
                        although, it is a good estimation. One could build upon the model to include 
                        enhancements such as, for a deadly disease, a chance of death with another 
                        Monte-Carlo simulation and include a death count in the graph. Another 
                        inclusion could be a Monte-Carlo simulation for the generation of a medicine 
                        and one to include the probability of someone actually getting the medicine 
                        which could provide immunity or even just improve the recovery chance and 
                        hence altering the graph to see a sharp decline in infections after the 
                        creation of the medicine.

                    <p class="maintxt">
                        Another completed project in the Molecular Dynamics module featured 1-D 
                        Spins and the Ising model. This model shows how a 1-D spin chain of spin 
                        “up” and spin “down” electrons behaves under the exchange interaction, 
                        and is used to predict macroscopic magnetic properties of solids. A single 
                        spin in the chain may flip from up to down due to an interaction with its 
                        neighbour which will then in turn influence its neighbours and hence 
                        propagate along the chain until an equilibrium is reached. The spin state 
                        of an electron depends on the ratio of the exchange energy to the thermal 
                        energy.
                        <br><br>
                        I was then tasked to modify pseudo code and perform Monte-Carlo 
                        simulations to calculate the heat capacity and compare it to the analytical 
                        solution. I also had to calculate the entropy of the equilibrium state by 
                        counting the number of like spin-chains and show this was a good estimate 
                        when compared to the analytical approach.
                        <br><br>

                        As there are a lot of different stages to this project, this GIAG will only 
                        focus on one of them and produce a plot of the internal energy, heat
                        capacity and entropy against the sample temperature of a ferromagnetic solid 
                        inside a magnetic field. It will also compare the results of the analytical 
                        solution which is found via a Taylor expansion with the Monte-Carlo 
                        simulation to show that the simulation gives an accurate representation and 
                        would be much faster if up-scaled.

                        Similar to the Spread of Disease project, current students might use this 
                        section to plagiarise code for easy marks, and as a result I am unable to 
                        share the code in this section. However, I will use this section to provide 
                        more details about the simulation without the use of the code.
                        <br><br>
                        I was first tasked with adapting the existing Maple code to work in 
                        Python and then correct the Monte-Carlo simulation to work as 
                        expected and compare to the analytical solution. This was done outside of 
                        a magnetic field (dissimilar to above) and so the thermodynamic probability 
                        of a spin “flipping” was proportional to the natural exponent of the ratio 
                        between the change in exchange energy (from flipping a single spin) and the 
                        thermal energy of the system. The exchange energy, J, is dependent on the 
                        spin state so that parallel spin pairs have an exchange energy of –J and +J 
                        for anti-parallel. This also means that the spin state of one electron is 
                        dependent on the spin state of its neighbours. This gives a useful insight 
                        into the material because if all spins are parallel, the system is 
                        ferromagnetic, and if all spins are anti-parallel, it is anti-ferromagnetic.

                    <p class="maintxt">
                        I then used this idea to create a plot of the heat capacity against the 
                        temperature for multiple ratios of exchange energy to Boltzmann constant 
                        (J/k) and see the effect of decreasing/increasing the coupling energy (J).
                        <br><br> 
                        Next, I wrote code to plot the systems entropy dependence on temperature 
                        and explain what happened at the extremes (T=0, T=+Inf). Following this, I 
                        derived theoretical expressions for the internal energy, heat capacity and 
                        entropy in the using a Taylor expansion in the limit of J=0 with the system 
                        in the presence of a magnetic field. The field was important as this now 
                        contributes to the aligning of spins parallel to the field and so the 
                        simulation must be adjusted to account this. Then using the equilibrium 
                        result from the simulation, you can count the number of parallel spin up and 
                        down regions and use the formula across to calculate the entropy from the 
                        total number of states.
                        <br><br>  
                        Please bear in mind that this explanation has been simplified greatly and 
                        the majority of the thermodynamics / statistical mechanics / condensed matter 
                        physics has be left out for the readers' convenience.
